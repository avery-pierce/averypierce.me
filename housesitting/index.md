# Housesitting

The garbage truck comes on Thursday. Push the cans out to the street on Wednesday night before you go to bed.

Here are where the garbage cans are:
- Kitchen (Main one)
- Downstairs bathroom
- Back patio (dog poop can)
- Bailey's office upstairs
- Avery's office upstairs
- Both bathrooms upstairs
- Master bedroom
  - One on each side of the master bed
  - One next to the dresser

We leave the front porch light on 24/7. We turn off the back patio light when we're not outside.

Please water the plants once before you leave. Fill the purple watering can, and pour a little water into each pot.

Check the mail each day, and check the front porch for deliveries. Instructions for the mailbox should written down at home.

If you're leaving the house, remember to lock up. The front door has a keypad lock. You can just press the "lock" button to lock the door. To unlock the door, just enter your combination.

## Living

The remote for the downstairs TV is the little silver Apple TV Remote. It also controls the TV volume via the soundbar. You can watch live cable TV with the Youtube TV app (not to be confused with the normal Youtube app).

Help yourself to anything in the kitchen. The Brez is a THC beverage. The mini-cans are 2.5mg (equivalent to half a gummy) and the tall cans are 5mg. We have plenty. They are stacked up in the basement like a cybertruck battery.

## Avery's Office

Feel free to setup in my office for your worday. The USB-C cable for the monitor also provides power and connects the webcam. I have an Apple Magic keyboard and Apple Magic Mouse you can use. All the cabels for that stuff should be sitting out.

# Dogsitting

In the house, Mabel wears the brown leash (house line). It doesn't have a handle in order to prevent it from getting caught on things around the house.

Take Mabel out to go potty regularly. She does not have a cue to go potty that we know of. Poop bags are lined up on the wall next to the back door. Use the green leash when you take her out.

The top purple cubby in the dining room contains most of Mabel's stuff. If there is something you're looking for, try looking there.

Don't worry about walking her – we're not in the habit of doing that and she's not fully leash-trained yet.

## Crate

When you are out of the house, at work, or in bed, you can leave Mabel in the crate. She understands the commands *"Go to den!"*, or *"Let's go den!"* as a command to go into the crate. As you close the door of the crate, lift up on the door so the bottom prongs slide down on the inside, then slide the latch to the right to lock it.

Try not to leave her in the crate for more than 4 hours at a time during the day. When you let her out of the crate, she might hesistate to come out – you can say *"Okay, free!"* to let her know it's okay to come out.

## Feeding

Mabel eats at the following times:
- 7:00 Breakfast
- 12:30 Lunch
- 6:30 Dinner

The feeding ritual has many steps.

She eats 2/3 cup at each meal time (total of 2 cups per day). There is a 1/3 cup scoop in the dog food container. We typically put half her meal (1 scoop) into her bowl, then the other half (another scoop) sprinkled on the bear-shaped "snuffle" mat.

1. Scoop food into the bowl and serve it to Mabel inside her crate (no need to close the door) – when she sees you scooping out the food, she will wait inside her crate to eat. 
2. While she's eating the first half of the meal, prepare the snuffle mat. Sprinkle a scoop of kibble onto the mat. You can even hide some pieces of kibble in the pockets of the bear's paws.
3. When Mabel finishes eating from the bowl, you can lay the snuffle mat on the floor. After you place it on the floor, say "Okay!" to give her permission to begin eating.

If you're in a hurry, you can also just put 2 scoops into her bowl and feed it to her.

**Refill her water dish daily.** She goes through it quickly.

There are pup-sickles in the freezer. If you need to keep her occupied for some reason, you can give her one of those, but don't give her more than 1 per day. To use them, find the green rubber holder in th purple cubby, place the pup-sicle inside, then screw the cap on.

No people food.
