            <p><strong>Nash</strong> has a blonde coat (left), and <strong>Edsel</strong> has a calico coat (right).</p>

            <p>Guinea pigs are prey animals, so they're instinctively very skittish. You can try to pet them if you want, but they will probably run and hide. I've found that they seem most comfortable when the lid of the cage is closed.</p>

                <h2>Feeding</h2>
            </header>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>1 vitamin C tablet per guinea pig per day</strong> fed by hand. Edsel really likes eating these â€“ Nash is less enhusiastic about it. If they don't take it out of your hand, you can leave it in the blue feeding bowl.</li>
                <li><strong>1 scoop of pellets each day</strong> served in the blue food dish. I usually feed them in the morning, but this is flexible. Don't go longer than 36 hours if you can help it.</li>
                <li><strong>A handful of romaine lettuce once (or twice) per day</strong> served in the blue food dish. I typically feed them some lettuce once in the morning (on top of the pellets), and once in the evening. However, one serving per day is perfectly fine.</li>
                <li><strong>Unlimited timothy hay</strong> strewn out on the floor of the cage. They probably won't eat all of it before you have to clean the cage.</li>
                <li><strong>Unlimited water</strong> in the water bottle. Note the "maximum fill line" printed on the bottle.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When adding food to the blue food dish, pick out any turds that were kicked into it (or just dump everything out into the trash). They graze on the pellets throughout the day, so if you're giving them a second serving of lettuce in the evening, don't be surprised if there's still some pellets left over.</p>
            
            <p>When Nash is hungry, he might gnaw on the bars of the cage to make noise in an effort to get your attention. Edsel doesn't have a hunger signal that I know of.</p>

                <h2>Cleaning</h2>
            </header>

            <p>Once per day (or every other day, if you don't have time to do it one day), you'll need to clean the droppings from the cage. The easiest way I've found to clean the cage is to fold the bottom lining in half (hot-dog style) and funnel it into the garbage can. You'll probably need to shake it a bit to get everything. Then, use the little broom and dust pan to sweep up any remaining droppings that are still on the floor of the cage.</p>
