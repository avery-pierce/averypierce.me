            <p>I'm a senior software engineer and manager, with a taste for building fully native iOS apps and lightweight websites (full-stack).</p>
            
            <p>I've been writing code in one form or another for over 15 years! Right now, my core skill set is Swift, Typescript (especially Deno), and React, but I also have experience with a variety of other tools and languages which you can see on my <a href="resume.html">resume</a>. I'm very resourceful and self-motivated – nearly all of my programming skills are self-taught through books, videos, and blogs.</p>
            
            <p>I'm excited about building awesome tools that empower people to do their jobs more effectively. That means writing clean code and designing intuitive and powerful user interfaces – it's easy to love software that loves you back!</p>

            <p>For the past 3 years, I've been working at Spin micromobility – first as a mobile app engineer for the consumer app, and more recently as an engineering manager on the fleet lifecycle team. During that time, I've built numerous features for the Spin app, including vehicle reservations, group rides, and a closed prototype for Ford AV's ride-hailing service.</p>

            </div>

            <p>I later took a position as engineering manager on Spin's fleet lifecyle team, working with the engineers responsible for their employee-focused app called "Spin Team". I also managed a team of backend engineers responsible for our partner integration with Lyft, and our mobility-as-a-service platform. More recently, I led the team to build a mobile app SDK to support micromobility regulatory requirements in the US.</p>

            <p>Prior to working at Spin, I was a full-time senior iOS app developer at Parts Town in Addison, Illinois. During that time, we've added feature after feature to our e-commerce and reference app, like interactive wire diagrams, smart manuals, and order history. In addition to writing the code for all these projects, I also took the helm on the UI and UX tasks. In fact, most of the icons in the Parts Town app were designed by me.</p>

            <p>The first iPhone app I wrote was based on a card game invented by a family member. The game was called Kardball, and I released it before the iPhone SDK supported ARC, which meant I had to write memory retain and release cycles by hand! (Unfortunately, the game is no longer on the App Store, because keeping it maintained was too much hassle)</p>
