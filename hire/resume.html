            <p>I'm a senior software engineer and manager, with a taste for building fully native iOS apps and lightweight websites (full-stack).</p>
            
            <p>I've been writing code in one form or another for over 15 years! Right now, my core skill set is Swift, Typescript (especially Deno), and React, but I also have experience with a variety of other tools and languages which are listed below. I'm very resourceful and self-motivated – nearly all of my programming skills are self-taught through books, videos, and blogs.</p>
            
            <p>I'm excited about building lovable tools that empower people in their day-to-day lives. That means writing clean code and designing intuitive and powerful user interfaces – it's easy to love software that loves you back!</p>
