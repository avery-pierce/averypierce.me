            <p><strong>2015</strong>: I came up with a way to deep-link digital business cards in a website so that they could be downloaded to a device.

            <p><strong>2011 - 2012</strong>: Developed a iPhone game called Kardball, based on a card game that was invented by a family member. (This app is no longer available in the app store).</p>
