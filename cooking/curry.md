title: Basic Curry

I make this once a week. I don't have a firm grasp on the measurements of the ingredients I use, but my advice is to be generous with your spices and flavors!

## Ingredients

You'll notice that I do not use precise measurements for most of these ingredients. Go with your gut! When I'm trying a new ingredient, I like to use more than I think I need so I can get a sense of what the ingredient tastes like, then reel it back the next time I use it.

### Staples

These ingredients almost always go into a batch of curry when I cook, and I recommend using them all – at least until you get comfortable.

* about 1 pound of chicken thighs (thawed, and cut into bit-size pieces)
* some kind of cooking oil (I  prefer peanut oil, but I'm sure any kind is okay)
* 1 can of coconut milk
* 1 bell pepper
* 1 white or yellow onion
* Curry powder, and lots of it!
* ginger paste (ground ginger from a spice shaker is not as good, but it's a decent substitute)
* Peanut butter (adds creaminess)
* salt
* black pepper

### Flavor and seasoning

Mix and match these extra ingredients to your liking. If you cook this regularly, you'll get attuned to which flavors you like best. Even if you don't add any of these, you'll still get a great dish. These are ordered based on which ones I personally use the most.

* minced garlic (about a spoonful)
* red pepper flakes (adds heat)
* cardamom
* coriander 
* rice vinegar (brightens the dish)
* coconut aminos (adds tang)
* roasted peanuts (for texture)
* cilantro (either as a topping, or in the broth, or both!)
* extra tumeric (chances are, your curry powder will have lots of tumeric already – but you might like a little more!)
* basil
* sesame oil (adds heat)
* honey (adds sweetness)
* coconut flakes (adds sweetness)
* allspice
* cinnamon
* cloves

## Prep

(This part isn't strictly necessary, but you might find that it adds some flavor)

Coat the chicken pieces in the cooking oil, and season with some salt, pepper, and curry powder. Put it in the fridge until you're ready to use it.

## Let's cook

1. If you're going to serve this over rice, get that started first.
2. Pour your cooking oil in a wok, and turn the heat up to medium.
3. If you're using any of these ingredients, now is a good time to add them in so they can saute in the oil a bit before you add your chicken (or other protein)
  * sesame oil
  * minced garlic
  * red pepper flakes
  * honey
4. Add the chicken and stir occasionally, until it's mostly cooked
5. Add the veggies, with some salt. Give the veggies a chance to cook down a bit. Feel free to add some spices here, too (go with your gut!)
  * bell pepper
  * onion
6. Add the coconut milk
7. Stir in any ingredients you haven't put in yet
8. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for a few minutes
9. Remove from heat, and serve with rice. Add chopped cilantro and crushed peanuts as a topping, if you like.

Enjoy!
