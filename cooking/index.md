Here are a few things I like to cook:

[Basic Stir Fry](./stir_fry) - I cook this once a week and make a little different each time. It's great for expermientation.

[Basic Curry](./curry) - This is good for experimentation too. I make this about once a week.

[Basic French Onion Dip](./passable_french_onion_dip) - When I'm hosting and I need some dip in a pinch, this works fairly well.
