Stir Fry
========

This is a dish I like to make once a week, and it comes out a little different each time. It's a great dish to experiment with different vegitables and spices. Below is a list of various ingredients I've used. I've yet to find a combination that comes out bad.

Serve with rice, or on its own.

Solids
------

For canned ingredients (pineapple, water chestnuts, etc), I prefer to drain the liquid first, but feel free to leave it in if you like your stir fry to be on the saucy side.

* Chicken (I recommend chicken thighs over breasts)
* Extra firm tofu
* Pineapple chunks
* Chopped (or sliced) bell peppers
* Chopped (or sliced) onions (I recommend either yellow or white)
* Broccoli
* Sliced white mushrooms
* Water chestnuts
* Bamboo shoots
* Baby corns
* Bean sprouts
* Raw cashews

Liquids
-------

* Peanut oil (for cooking)
* Sesame oil (for flavor)
* Soy sauce
* Coconut aminos (tastes like soy sauce, but without the soy)
* Rice vinegar
* Apple cider vinegar
* Honey

Spices and flavors
------------------

* Salt (feel free to experiment here â€“ different salts affect the dish a little differently)
* Black pepper
* Ginger (I find this to be a really important component. You can use fresh grated ginger root, store-bought ginger paste, or ground ginger. They each work a little differently)
* Chili powder
* Paprika
* Minced garlic
* Cardamom (a little bit goes a long way)
* Tajin (this is a tangy spice blend you can find at Aldi, and probably other grocers. Pairs great with pineapple)
* Chopped cilantro
* Curry powder
* Red pepper flakes

Hardware
--------

* Wok with a lid
* Wooden paddle

Process
-------

This process isn't set in stone, feel free to mix it up (just make sure your chicken is cooked completely).

### Season the chicken

If you're using chicken, I suggest marinating the chicken in some peanut oil and some of the spices above. You can do this the night before, or 5 minutes before.

### Pre-cook the tofu in the oven, if desired.

When I use tofu, I like to season it, and bake it in the oven ahead of time. I follow [this recipe](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/baked-tofu/).

### Stir fry

1. Add your oils to the wok, and heat it up.
2. If you're using minced garlic and/or red pepper flakes, you can add those now.
3. If you're using chicken or **uncooked** tofu, add it now. Let it cook about halfway before moving on to the next step.
4. If you're adding pineapple, add it now. Give it a little time to carmelize before moving on.
5. Add any dry vegitables you're using (broccoli, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms), remaining liquids and seasonings. Stir it up good, and then cover for a minute or two to let the steam do its work.
6. Add any wet vegitables you're using (water chestnuts, baby corns, baboo shoots, etc). Stir some more.
7. Add cashews and/or pre-cooked tofu.
8. Cook and stir until it looks good.
9. Remove from heat, and let it cool for a minute before serving
